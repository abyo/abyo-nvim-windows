# neoVim LUA config for Windows 10

Migrating to LUA in progress.

I'm using a nerd font (to use glyphs in certain plugins) called `Hack Nerd
Font`. You can use it or use a different one. Here's a [direct link to
it](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/Hack.zip).

## How to install LUA on Windows 10

If you want to work with LUA on Windows, it's pretty confusing.  It doesn't
have to be! Just install everything you need with [WinLua](http://winlua.net/).

## ToDo

- [x] Add more information on the README file
- [x] Change project architecture
- [ ] Snippets integration
- [x] Fix sessions loading/saving by moving to Startify?
- [ ] Finish generic config
- [x] Terminal integration

## Mappings

You can find all mappings in the [mapping file](mappings.md). If you're looking
for the file where all mappings are, [here it is](/settings/keymap.lua).
