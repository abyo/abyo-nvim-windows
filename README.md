# neoVim LUA config for Windows 10

Migrating to LUA in progress.

I'm using a nerd font (to use glyphs in certain plugins) called `Hack Nerd
Font`. You can use it or use a different one. Here's a [direct link to
it](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/Hack.zip).

If you're planning on using the `Octo` plugin, you need to install the
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

## How to install LUA on Windows 10

If you want to work with LUA on Windows, it's pretty confusing. It doesn't
have to be! Just install everything you need with [WinLua](http://winlua.net/).

## ToDo

- [ ] Add wiki pages (how to add keymaps, plugins and !snippets!)
- [x] Change fzf to telescope (check doc)
- [ ] Change git wrapper (lazygit)
- [ ] Add whichkey plugin/config
- [ ] Check todo comments
- [ ] Finish generic config

## Mappings

You can find all mappings in the [mapping file](mappings.md). If you're looking
for the file where all mappings are, [here it is](/settings/keymap.lua).
